# Exhibition-Feedback-System
Programming Language: C++
Project Period: 01/05/2023 - 10/06/2023
Developed a Feedback System to be displayed in public during the Physics Exhibition held at Dewan Suara.
The System takes in user inputs and then calculates the total average rating of a group from 1 to 5 stars.
The details keyed in by the user are then recorded to a text file and returned when needed to calculate the ratings.
