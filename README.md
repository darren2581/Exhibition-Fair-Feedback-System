# Exhibition-Feedback-System
**Programming Language**: C++
<br/>
**Project Period**: 01/05/2023 - 10/06/2023
<br/>
Developed a Feedback System to be displayed in public during the Physics Exhibition to get the public to give ratings.
<br/>
The System takes in user inputs and then calculates the total average rating of a group from 1 to 5 stars.
<br/>
The details keyed in by the user are then recorded to a text file and returned when needed to calculate the ratings.
